    2 tablespoons butter
    ⅓ cup chopped onion
    1 ½ cups sauerkraut, drained and minced
    salt and pepper to taste

    1 (8 ounce) container sour cream
    3 large eggs
    3 cups all-purpose flour
    1 tablespoon baking powder
    ¼ teaspoon salt

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</li>
        <li>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add <em>pierogies</em> in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
